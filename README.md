*Abstract.* 

**Background.** As of 16 May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths
from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have
been reported. Reliable estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential to
understand clinical prognosis, plan health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting. The case
fatality ratio (CFR), calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the
most commonly reported metric, but can be a misleading measure of overall mortality. The
objectives of this study were to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using
publicly available surveillance data; 2) infer estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for
biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR) and the infection fatality
ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations.

**Method and Findings.** We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed
(SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during
the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of
severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance
data from Hubei province, China and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria,
Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Württemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain and Switzerland.
In Hubei, the baseline estimates were: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 2.1-2.8%), sCFR
3.7% (3.2-4.2%) and IFR 2.9% (2.4-3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time.
Across the six locations in Europe estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR,
adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity.
Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4-0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1-1.6%) in
Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among 80+ year olds, estimates
of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges
from 20% (95% CrI: 16-26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI: 28-40%) in Spain. A limitation
of the model is that count data by date of onset are required and these are not available in all
countries.

**Conclusions.** We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality
from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality
from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings.
Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to
estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR,
adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can
be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
